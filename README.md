# address-book

This is my first Python/Flask project. If you have Cloud9 account, it can also be viewed here: https://ide.c9.io/sarahrae44/address-book

I coded along with a tutorial on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/python-flask-course) and built a blog app (https://ide.c9.io/sarahrae44/flask-blog) - highly recommended if new to both of these!

Time for training/coding along with tutorial: ~18 hours
Time for building address app, using tutorial as reference: ~2-3 hours
Time for researching how to integrate USPS API/get Github to integrate with Cloud9 (both incomplete): ~4 hours

Total dev time: 24 hours
